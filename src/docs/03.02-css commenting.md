All stylesheets should properly commented with a clear table of contents in each file which title can be used to copy jump to the section/block for those set of selectors.

For example below a sample stylesheet can be found with a table of content can a copy jump titles and naming for blocks within the stylesheet. This can be used as starting point for every new stylesheet to be created. Once the files spans across hundreds of lines of code copy and finding of any index entry like "03 - Block C" can help a developer to jump on to that section so we need to make sure exactly same titles are used in the blocks also.

```CSS
/*==============================================================================
Index
----------------------------------------
01 - Block A
02 - Modifier for Block A
03 - Element with in Block A
04 -
05 -
06 -
07 -
08 -
==============================================================================*/

/* --------------------
01 - block a
-------------------- */
/* All styles for Block A go here */

/* 02 - Modifier for Block A */
/* All styles for Block A Modifier go here */

/* 03 - Element with in Block A */
/* All styles for Element in Block A go here */

```
